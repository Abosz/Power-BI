# Power-BI

You will find here different analysis
and dashboards made in Power BI with appropriate file. 

1. SALES DASHBOARD
   My first serious project in Power BI in my daily work. 
   It contains informations and customer claims of each sales representative. It comes with made up dataset, but you can see it's functionalities and my skills in DAX.
   File "Reklamacje" is main made up dataset, and file "Clients" contains additional (also made up) information used in data model in PBI.  

2. EMPLOYEES AND TEAMS DASHBOARD 
   It's a PBI project that answer questions and needs such as:
      - Which person worked the most and which worked the least? The list should make it possible to check each person and filter by team.
      - Considering that the working time per month was 176 hours, who achieved the expected project working time level of 50%?
      - Which team and which person have the biggest problem with the use of working time?
      - Create a visualization showing the share of individual types of reports (error, modification, consultation, etc.) in the total number of works.
      - Create a report enabling you to verify how many hours are set aside for clients in particular subsystems.
