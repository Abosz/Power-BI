# Power-BI

You will find here different analysis
and dashboards made in Power BI with appropriate file. 

1. SALES DASHBOARD - My first serious project in Power BI in my daily work. This is template of claims dashboard for whole Sales Department in my company.
   It contains informations and customer claims of each sales representative. It comes with made up dataset, but you can see it's functionalities and my skills in DAX.
   File "Reklamacje" is main made up dataset, and file "Clients" contains additional (also made up) information used in data model in PBI.  

2. Data Sciene Jobs - quick analysis with different charts
   and some simple DAX measures and more complicated nested IF statement.
   ds_salaries.csv is a dataset used in this PBI report.
